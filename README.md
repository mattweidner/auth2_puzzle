# auth2_puzzle

Reverse engineer the binary to discover the passcode.

* auth2: 64-bit dynamically linked binary
* auth2-static: 64-bit statically linked binary
* auth2-32bit: 32-bit dynamically linked binary
* auth2-static-32bit: 32-bit statically linked binary

If you are having problems with one of the dynamically linked binaries, give one of the static builds a try.
